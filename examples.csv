"IBM Cloud Satellite helps you deploy and run applications consistently across all on-premises, edge computing, and public cloud environments from any cloud vendor. It standardizes a core set of Kubernetes, data, AI, and security services to be centrally managed as a service by IBM Cloud, with full visibility across all environments through a single pane of glass. The result is greater developer productivity and development velocity.","IBM Cloud Satellite enables consistent deployment and operation of applications across all on-premises, edge computing, and public cloud environments from various cloud providers.
